                 This visual marque was designed while working on my personal
                 brand. I explored all avenues including wordmarks, monograms
                 and visual marques.
               </p>
               <p>
                 I choose to use my monogram in the end as I think it has a
                 stronger visual impact. However, I really loved this visual
                 marque.
