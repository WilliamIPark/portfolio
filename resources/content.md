About

My Work & I

My name is William, as I’m sure you have gathered! I am an Interaction Designer based in Northern Ireland.  What does that mean? I create designs for anything you interact with - websites, posters, business cards - you name it!

Careful consideration goes into all my designs. I make sure they are modern and as interactive as they can be, while ensuring they are accessible.

My Journey So far...

I started off with design when I was 12, creating silly (and now, cringe worthy) forum signatures. It may have been silly back then, but design gripped me and has stayed with me since, as I now study design at University.

As I explored the internet a creative curiosity always caught me, and I had a constant desire to want to learn. I learned skills in graphic creation, using software like Photoshop and Illustrator. I learned skills in building websites, like HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

In more recent years I've been studying at University, and in my free time teaching myself. At University I study Interaction Design, a visual approach to design and planning. I've been teaching myself how websites work, and how to manipulate the back-end of them.

With both these areas of knowledge combined it gives me a wide angle view on what to consider in my designs. I can create beautiful designs that build on the under-laying interactivity.
