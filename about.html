  <h2>My work & I</h2>
  <p>My name is William, as I’m sure you have gathered! I am an Interaction Designer based in Northern Ireland.
    What does that mean? I create designs for anything you interact with - websites, posters, business cards - you name it!</p>

  <p>Careful consideration goes into all my designs. I strive to make my designs modern and as interactive as they can be, while ensuring they are accessible.</p>
