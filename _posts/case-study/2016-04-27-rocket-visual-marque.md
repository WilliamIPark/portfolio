When developing my personal brand I explored all aspects of having a visual representation for the brand. This included monograms, visual marques, and wordmarks. This visual marque wasnâ€™t used, but it is worth showing because it shows part of the process I used to get to where my brand is now - and I love the graphic.

The rocket embodies exploration, experimentation, and discovery. Things that stand out to me, as this is exactly what I love to do with design. My passion for design is my rocket ship.

I stumbled across this idea when I created the pen tip graphic and used multiple pen tips to create a crown graphic. I added a handle on to the pen tip during a bit of experimentation and just seen a rocket in it. I got some feedback from people and did a few different versions of the graphic, which is also shown here.
