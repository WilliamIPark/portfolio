Using an API on your web application can be an extremely powerful tool. But what is an API? An
API is a system that you can plug into to send and receive data. Think of Google Maps - you can plug
into it to show users locations on a map using the Google Maps interface. Now think of Instagram. People
upload images to Instagram with locations all the time, and Instagram also has an API. You could
combine both API's together to create an app that displays Instagram images took nearby a pin set on
your Google Map.
